        <h3 id="headline">The Life of Marusya</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1885</strong> - Born in Aleksandrovsk, Ukraine, ostensibly the daughter of an officer who had served in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78. </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1901</strong> - Leaving home aged 16, Marusya was able to find employment over the next few years first as a baby sitter, then a sales clerk and, finally, a bottle washer in a vodka distillery.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>c. 1903</strong> - During this time Anarcho-Communist groups began to be established in Ukraine, and Marusya joined one early on in the run up to the 1905 Revolution. It seems to be the case that she joined such a group at the same time as she got her job at the distillery: the working-class youth of Ukraine were particularly attracted to the anarchists.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1905-1907</strong> - Following the failure of the 1905 Revolution that came in the wake of the Russo-Japanese War, there was a period of intense revolutionary violence, and Marusya enthusiastically involved herself in bomb attacks and robberies. Eventually, in 1907, she was arrested by police after a bomb she attempted suicide with failed to go off.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1908</strong> - She was tried for the killing of a policeman and four seperate robberies and intitially sentenced to death, but due to her age, and, likely, her gender, this was commuted to 20 years hard labour and exile to Siberia. She initially spent time at the Petropavlovosk fortress in St.Petersburg, before being sent to Siberia.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>c. 1909</strong> - Within a few months of arriving in Siberia, she organised a  riot at the Narymsk prison and escaped. Travelling along the Great Siberian Railway after fleeing through the taiga, she travelled to Japan via Vladivostok. In Japan, she met with Chinese anarchists who bought her a ticket to the US. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>c. 1910</strong> - Marusya's time in the US was spent among anarchist émigrés from the Russian Empire, many of whom were Jewish, who had settled mostly in New York and Chicago. While there, she wrote and published articles in the Russian-language anarchist press under various pseudonyms. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1912</strong> - Returning to Europe, Marusya moves to Paris and makes contact with Spanish anarchists. She passes on tactical lessons from her time with her Ukrainian anarchist terror group, taking part in a bank robbery in Barcelona during which she was wounded and undergoing treatment, secretly, in France.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1913</strong> - Moving back to Paris from Spain in the autumn, she spends time with other Russian political figures as well as artists and poets. She attended an art school, and met and married the Polish anarchist Witold Bzhostek, and although they spent large periods of time apart, they were devoted to each other. At the end of the year, she attended a conference of Russian anarcho-communists held in London.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1914</strong> - With the outbreak of war, Marusya sided with the pro-war radical left, which included figures such as Kropotkin. She enlisted in the French Foreign Legion and graduated from an officer academy.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1915</strong> - During 1915, she was sent as part of the French contingent to the Salonika or Macedonian Front, as part of a plan to assist the beleagured Serbian army. This force contained troops from the British, French, Russian, Greek, Serbian and Italian armies as well as colonial troops from Senegal, Indochina, and elsewhere.

          <li>
            <strong>1917</strong> - When news of the 1917 Revolution and the abdication of Czar Nicholas II came, Marusya left Salonika and travelled to the capital of Imperial Russia, Petrograd (previously St. Petersburg), where she threw herself wholeheartedly into revolutionary activity. During July, she gave speeches to between 8-10,000 sailors and others in Anchor Square at the naval base of Kronstadt that contributed to many sailors joining the failed July Days revolt against the Provisional Government. Given sanctuary by the sailors she had inspired, she travelled back to Alexandrovsk. There she joined the Alexandrovsk Anarchist Federation and took part in expropriations of money and arms, passing both to local anarchists and the Alexandrovsk Soviet. She also met Nestor Makhno at Gulyai-Pole. In September she was arrested by the Soviet authorities but released under enormous pressure from Alexandrovsk and Gulyai-Pole anarchists.
          </li>
          <li><strong>The October Revolution: 1917</strong> - Following the successful Bolshevik coup d'etat agains the Provisional Government in October, she immediately began to form 'Black Guard' detachments throughout the autumn, which were used to great success in seizing Kharkov and Ekaterinoslav from the Ukrainan nationalist soldiers. Marusya's trademark became looting the shops and distributing their contents to the people of the towns and cities her detachment liberated. Her own Black Guard detachment joined with Makhno as part of the Revolutionary Insurgent Army of Ukraine (also known as the Black Army). </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Civil War: 1918</strong> - With the Bolshevik dismissal of the Constituent Assembly in January, civil war was inevitable. During the year, Marusya became leader of a group of anarchist militia known as the Free Combat <i>Druzhina</i>, making her the only woman commanding a large revolutionary military group in Ukraine - an Atamansha. The <i>Druzhina</i>, consisting of armoured cars, tachanka horse-drawn wagons with machine-guns, two field guns, and an armoured train, quickly became a fearsome sight on the Ukrainian steppe and in the Crimea. They liberated Yalta and freed anarchists from Bolshevik arrest at Sevastopol, as well as taking part in the battles for Elizavetgrad in the early part of the year. They fought for Alexandrovsk against the Ukrainian Nationalists before having to retreat from the German Army. During the retreat, relations between the anarchists and the Bolsheviks deteriorated, and this culminated in a trial in Taganrog against Marusya and the <i>Druzhina</i>. They were acquitted, and later slipped away from Bolshevik arrest as the Germans drove the Red and Black armies out of Ukraine.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1919</strong> - Arriving in Saratov, the <i>Druzhina</i> were disarmed by the Bolsheviks and Marusya arrested again. She was taken to Moscow and was found guilty of "discrediting Soviet power by her deeds and by the actions of her brigade in several instances; and of insubordination in relation to local Soviets in the sphere of military activities." Unusually, she was not shot, instead being sentenced to six months' deprivation of the right to hold positions of responsibility. Incensed, Marusya travelled back to Gulyai-Pole, where, in the vacuum left by the now-absent German Army, Makhno and the Black Army had, with Bolshevik agreement, set up an anarchist enclave. Here she reluctantly took part in administration of civilian efforts, but agitated constantly to be allowed to fight again: eventually during a visit by senior Bolsheviks, she was successful. In May she travelled to Berdyansk to set up an underground anarchist group, and here she met up with her husband again. In June the Bolsheviks turned on Makhno and the anarchists. Hearing of this, Marusya and her group travelled to meet Makhno, where, after a tense standoff, she took 250,000 roubles and left for Crimea to attempt to blow up General Denikin, the commander of the White Volunteer Army.  
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>August 1919</strong> - On August 11, 1919, Marusya was recognized on the street in Sevastopol and she and her husband were arrested by the Whites. Unable to rescue them, the rest of her group fled to the Kuban area, taking part in partisan activities against the Whites there. The trial of Marusya and her husband Bzhostek, actually a field court-martial, was held on September 16, 1919 before General Subbotin, commandant of Sevastopol Fortress. The pair were found guilty and sentenced to death.  Marusya was defiant throughout the proceedings and swore at the court after the sentence was read. She only broke down briefly while saying goodbye to her husband. They were shot at some time between the 16th and the 19th of September.
          </li>
          </ul>
      <h3>Marusya the Anarchist</h3>
<p>Throughout her short life, Marusya was a dedicated revolutionary, to the utmost. She was a fiery and inspirational orator, an artist, a skilled soldier, a writer, a bank robber, a terrorist bomber, and first, always, and foremost, an anarchist. She was a deeply principled person, who was described by her friend Karelin as an unselfish teetotaler: "All she had she gave away even to comrades she barely knew. She wouldn't keep a kopeck for herself. She gave away everything."
</p>
<p>While she represented the destructive side of anarchism, the force that sweeps away the old order in a blaze of blood and fire, she was concerned with the constructive side too. In December 1918 she attended the First All-Russian Congress of Anarchist Communists in Moscow, giving a speech in which she said that "Anarchists must not restrict themselves to the big stuff. Any kind of work is useful.To sacrifice oneself is easier than to work constantly, steadily, achieving definite goals. Such work demands great staying power and a lot of energy." Marusya, ultimately, did not have the temperament for such work, instead putting her talents towards fighting the legions of enemies arrayed against the anarchist movement in Ukraine and around the world.

        <p>
            "The workers and peasants must, as quickly as possible, seize everything that was created by them over many centuries and use it for their own interests."
